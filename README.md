# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview:
This analysis trains and compares various machine learning models to predict credit risk.  The resuls are compared through the balance accuracy score, the confusions matrix, and classfication report of each algorithm.  The confusion matrix demonstrates the performance of the algorithm by displyaing the number of true positives, false negatives, false positives, and true negatives.  The precision and sensitivity (also called recall) of the algorithm can be determined by adding and dividing the confusion matrix numbers in various combintions.  A classification report performs and displays those computations so they do not have to be performed separately.


## Results:
### Deliverable 1: Oversampling, Undersampling, and SMOTE
* The class distribution of a dataset can be adjusted by oversampling and undersampling.  These techniques can be useful in working with an unbalanced dataset.  SMOTE stands for Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique and addresses and imbalanced dataset by oversampling the minority class.

* Oversampling:
