# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview:
This analysis trains and compares various machine learning models to predict credit risk.  The resuls are compared through the balance accuracy score, the confusions matrix, and classfication report of each algorithm.

--explain why using those test-- 17.4.2 -- confusion matrix (sensitivy and precision) & classification report - metrics on CM
